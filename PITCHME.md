### What is GIS? 
> @size[.6em](A geographic information system <GIS> is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing data. Rooted in the science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data. It analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes. ​With this unique capability, GIS reveals deeper insights into data, such as patterns, relationships, and situations—helping users make smarter decisions.)

### GIS Support for Environmental Policy 
### Research and Practice
+++
##### Asset Mapping
- Data collection using GPS equipment
- Digitized from existing plans/blueprints
- Provide representation of spatial distribution of assets/hazards
+++

---
##### Risk/Vulnerability Modeling
- Combine various natural and social components of risk or vulnerability to environmental hazards to provide composite picture of risk/vulnerability.
- Reduce technical information into more meaningful and actionable knowledge for decision/policy makers

##### Information Dissemination/Storytelling
- Story Maps convey place-based narratives about a topic or idea
- Mashups of maps, text, and multimedia in an interactive web applications
- Effective and engaging communication in a web browser
